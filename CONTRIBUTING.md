## Contribute code to Papers

### Setting up Papers locally

1. Install Rust using [rustup](https://www.rustup.rs), which allows you to easily switch between Rust
   versions.
2. Clone this repository.
3. Now, try running the test suite to confirm everything works for you locally
   by executing `cargo test`. (Initially, this will take a while to compile
   everything.)

### Git Commit Guidelines

We use [gitmojis](https://gitmoji.carloscuesta.me/) for our commit messages. It would be cool
if you adapt this when contributing to Papers.

### Code reviews

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We use Github pull requests for this purpose.
